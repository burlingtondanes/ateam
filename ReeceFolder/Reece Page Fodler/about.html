                                            <p class="proin-right-text">William Hartnell as Doctor Who once said “if you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you?” As an 8 year old boy, watching “An Unearthly Child” this quote changed me and my outlook on life immensely. In fact it helped me to see what I want to become in life, an Astronautical engineer and a researcher in cognitive neuroscience.
Most people do not believe that there is a link between these two fields but I believe there is. Astronautics allows us an insight into the universe we live in, explanations for its machinations, in laymen’s terms; what makes reality tick. Our knowledge will always grow after technology takes its next stride. Neuroscience can be related to this however. Studying the universe and how we fit into the cosmic puzzle can offer insights into how and why the human collective behave as they do. Behavioral psychology, including fields such as the social and developmental approach, assumes that the environment affects how we act (and in relation to neuroscience, how it affects our brain structure in terms of brain plasticity) and think, though who are any of us to decide that our environment is limited only to the Earth? The celestial plane and our understanding of the universe has more than once played a key role in human civilization and one doesn’t have to look much further than the Copernicus cosmic model’s impact on society to see that) 
These two fields are my career ambitions and have allowed me to develop key skills that allow me to contribute effectively to the work place. One skill for example is the ability to interpret and interact with statistical data. This allows me to spot general trends in observations, which allow me to review existing methods and suggest improvements to strategy. It also allows me to comment on hypotheses and determine whether a variable is statically independent or mutually exclusive to another event. 
Another skill I have developed from my career ambition is the ability to think logically and apply that rationale to problem solving. For example, the cognitive approach of psychology can make the assumption that human thought processes, the way we think and what enables us this ability can be likened to a basic computer system model of Inputs -> Processing -> Outputs. Using that and the computer engineering knowledge applied for astronautics, one can better identify and predict human thoughts and future behaviors as well as the ability to distinguish potential socio- and psycho-paths (as a generalized example).
Astronautics has allowed me to develop skills regarding computer maintenance. I have taught myself how to format built in drivers, upgrade hardware components such as RAM and repair corrupted drives using recovery media. I intend to use this knowledge for two self-appointed projects
1.  Have a network or Linux Operating Systems running on a school network
2.  Develop a program that allows people with paralysis (such as MND) to interact with objects using a neural interface (Cognitive Neuroscience in practice) with a specially designed arm apparatus (configured to be able to interact with household appliances).
One of my ambitions is to travel around South East Asia during my gap year and eventually make it my home. I believe that “Travel does broaden the mind” and the Asian continent has such a wide variety of people and cultures that it will prove to be a very enlightening experience/ I want to backpack and walk the rural regions of Vietnam, meeting the farmers, learning about Songkran first hand in Thailand and navigate the beautiful neon jungle of Tokyo. After that I can truly say that I have learned what it means to be human.            
KEY SKILLS:
-   Public Speaking 
-   Logical and efficient 
-   Innovative mind 
-   Very punctual
