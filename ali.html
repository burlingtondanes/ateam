  <div id="div5">
    <p>Hey. I'm Ali.<br> I'm 17. My birthday is in October. <br>I enjoy/like all sorts of things.<br> I'm quite a passive person in my opinion. <br>I also try to be nice whenever I can and I like being honest.</p>
    FUN FACT: I have 4 older brothers and I am the youngest,<br> with the oldest being 29 and the second youngest being 20.

    <p>Trees</p>
  </div>
  <div id="div1">
    <p>Trees are REALLY amazing. <br>This is simply because without trees, <br>there would be barely any life on Earth <br>since they produce all of our oxygen and filter out most air pollutants.</p>
    <p>Before cutting down any trees, you must be grateful since you owe them your life.</p>
    FUN FACT: Without trees, there wouldn't be any rain.

  <div id="div2">
    <p>Stars are FANTASTIC!!! Aren't they really amazing!?!? <br>There are simply more stars than you can ever begin to imagine. <br>The fact that we can see so many of them in the night sky is truly amazing!!!</p>
    FUN FACT: The sun is a star!!!!

  <div id="Mountains" style="color: gray; font-size:50px">
    <p>Mountains</p>
  </div>
  <div id="div3">
    <p>Mountains are really GREAT. Mountains are literally the Earth itself. <br>They are created when two of the Earth's tectonic plates collide into<br> each other and one of them gets pushed up and forms a mountain.</p>
    FUN FACT: Most scientists agree that the Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa is the<br> oldest mountain range on Earth (3.6 billion years old),<br> and it is said that it is possible to deduce the entire geological history of the Earth by<br> examining these
    uprising mountains in this ancient sea floor area.<br> (The picture isn't the Barberton Greenstone Belt by the way)

  <div id="The_Ocean" style="color: blue; font-size:50px">
    <p>The Ocean</p>
  </div>
  <div id="div4">
    <p>The Ocean is seriously breathtaking. The Ocean is just so vast and massive.<br> The total area of land on Earth doesn't nearly even come close to the amount of area that the Ocean takes up. <br>96.5% of the Earth is made up of water!!! <br>It's like the ocean
      is a whole different world where fish and only fish live.<br> While fish can't live out of water, humans or other animals can't live in water! Astonishing!!!!
    </p>
    FUN FACT: There are over 3.5 trillion fish in the sea.
