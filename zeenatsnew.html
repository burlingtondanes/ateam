                <h2 style="color:purple;">Education</h2>
                <p>I am a year 12 student who currently studies Art, Computer science, English Literature and a Finance AS-level. I have passed all my GCSEs.From all my subjects I currently prefer English the most becuase I understand it the most and it is open to many interpretations and ideas so it doesnt limit you in terms of choices for your take on a woute or character. I come from an external school where my choices were ICT, ART,sociology, French and history. From which I most enjoyed sociology because it applies to the world around us. </p>
                <h2 style="color:purple;">Achievements</h2>
                <p> In my short lifetime I have managed too gain an art scholarship, sports leaders qualification level (i dont remember) and have made it through GCSEs alive.Now tune in to watch me barely survive A-levels. I hope you have fun watching me suffer.(I dont remember the rest, when I do I shall update this area)</p>
                <h2 style="color:purple;">On to More interesting things...Travelling...</h2>
                <p> I love travelling. However, I tend to always bounce between these main countries: Belgium, Dubai and Pakistan. This is becuase my uncle lives in Belgium,whom Im going to go visit in March 2017,and because my Parents come from Pakistan. Though I have been to other countries such as France and Spain. On my trip to France, I went to Disney Land Paris, it was amazing, it is however quite small and I think it would've been more fun if I went at a younger age. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it very much and my favourite ride was the finding nemo one. Moreover, from all my journeys, Spain was the best by far, mainly because of the liveliness and colourfulness.In spain I visited the barcelona stadium (eventhough I support Real Madrid) and awed at the gothic quarter, was amazed at the intense detail put into making the cathedral and enjoyeda coconut milkshake from the St. Joseph market "La Boqueria". It was amazing the beaches were beautiful at barceloneta and so was the artwork in the building within the                  city of Gaudi.On the way back we stopped off at the CosmoCaixa and before leaving we watched a flamenco dance. I would definately go back anyday becuase I love the culture, it was so joyous, and the cuisine was mouth watering. However, I currently have a list of countries I would like to visit first, these include: Barbados, Italy, Canada and a couple of others. In the future, I hope to go on a tour of the world.</p>
